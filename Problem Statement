FLYGO is striving to scale its network while maintaining strong operational performance, profitability, and customer satisfaction in an increasingly competitive airline market. Although the airline has visibility into individual metrics such as revenue, delays, route performance, and customer feedback, these insights currently exist in silos, making it difficult for leadership to understand how operational reliability, route economics, and customer experience together influence long-term business performance.

As a result, key strategic decisions related to route expansion, route shutdown, fleet deployment, pricing optimization, and service improvements are being made without a holistic, data-driven view of network profitability, Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), on-time performance, and customer satisfaction. This leads to underperforming routes continuing to drain resources, high-demand routes facing service quality challenges, and missed opportunities to maximize revenue from high-growth corridors.

You as a Data Analyst are required to integrate operational, financial, and customer datasets to build a performance intelligence framework that identifies profitable and loss-making routes, evaluates service reliability and customer satisfaction, and provides actionable insights to support network expansion, route rationalization, and overall profitability improvement for FLYGO Airlines.
